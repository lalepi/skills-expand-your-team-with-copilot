# Mergington High School Activities

A super simple website application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities

## Requesting Changes

Teachers and staff can easily request changes to the system without needing to know how to code! We've created simple forms for common requests:

- **Add a new activity** - Request a new extracurricular activity
- **Modify an activity** - Change schedules, descriptions, or capacity
- **Manage registrations** - Add or remove students from activities
- **Report a bug** - Let us know if something isn't working
- **Suggest improvements** - Share ideas to make the website better
- **Request new features** - Propose new capabilities

Simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/lalepi/skills-expand-your-team-with-copilot/issues/new/choose) and select the template that fits your needs. The Copilot coding agent will automatically process your request!

For detailed information about using issue templates, see the [Issue Templates Guide](../docs/issue-templates-guide.md).
